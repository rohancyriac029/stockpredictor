# üìà Multivariate LSTM Stock Price Predictor

This project demonstrates how to build a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the closing price of a stock. It uses historical price data along with several technical indicators as features to create a more robust and context-aware prediction model.

The example uses the **iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF (AAXJ)**, but the framework can be easily adapted for any stock or time-series dataset.

## üìä Final Prediction Plot

The model's performance is evaluated by plotting the predicted prices against the actual prices on the test dataset.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

-   **Multivariate Input:** Uses multiple features (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, `SMA`, `RSI`) instead of just a single time series.
-   **Automated Feature Engineering:** Leverages the `pandas_ta` library to easily calculate and append technical indicators like Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
-   **Stacked LSTM Architecture:** Implements a deep neural network with two stacked LSTM layers for learning complex temporal patterns.
-   **Data Normalization:** Employs `MinMaxScaler` to scale all features, which is crucial for the stable training of neural networks.
-   **Clear Visualization:** Plots the actual vs. predicted prices for a clear, visual evaluation of the model's performance.
